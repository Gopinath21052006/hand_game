🎮 Rock – Paper – Scissors (Hand Game)

A simple, interactive Rock–Paper–Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This was one of my earliest projects, created to learn the basics of DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic — and now preserved as part of my developer journey!

🤖 Computer Generates Random Moves

🏆 Real-time score tracking

💬 Result messages (“You Win”, “You Lose”, “Tie”)

⚡ Instant updates (no page reloads)

🎨 Simple and clean UI

🛠️ Tech Stack

🎮 How It Works

Player clicks one of the emojis:

👊 Rock

✋ Paper

✌ Scissor

Computer randomly chooses one option.

JavaScript compares both choices and updates:

Player Choice

Computer Choice

Result Message

Scoreboard

🎯 What I Learned

✔ DOM selections (document.getElementById, onclick)
✔ Event-driven logic
✔ Random value generation (Math.random())
✔ Conditional decision-making
✔ Updating UI dynamically

This project played a big role in building my foundational understanding of JavaScript.
